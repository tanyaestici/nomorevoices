# No More Voices Telegram Bot 
It's a small Telegram bot that aims to call out unsolicited voice messages in chats. 

## Motivation
A silly pet project to exercise in Python and HTTP APIs. Some of my friends hate listening to voice messages, while others like bombing with them. This grumpy bot reminds to chat members to choose text instead.
